          Dar Al-Islam of Boston, Inc. (DIB) helps Muslims fulfill their
          obligatory Juma'a Prayers every Friday in Downtown Boston. DIB started
          organizing the Friday congregation in December 1999. Its sole
          objective is to provide a convenient prayer place in Downtown Boston
          to enable Muslims fulfill their obligation.

          the weekly congregation. The prayers currently take place in the hall
